<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! This is <b>Tanisha</b> and I am an Engineering Student with a passion for building robust digital systems. 
While my academic background has trained me to solve complex physical and mathematical problems, my journey into Web Development allows me to apply that same logic to the digital world.</p>
<p>Currently, I am mastering the HTML/CSS/JavaScript triad to create clean, responsive user interfaces. 
My goal is to evolve into a Full-Stack Developer, utilizing frameworks like React and Node.js to build scalable applications that solve real-world problems. 
I believe great code is like great engineering: it should be efficient, reliable, and built to last.  </p>
<p><b>"Growth Mindset"—a trait highly valued in tech.</b>
